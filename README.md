My personal website

Welcome to my website :)
I wanted to create a website that would allow potential employers to learn more about me and would allow access to all my other social media pages. After fiddling around with Bootstrap and Jquery, I settled on a simple interface that integrated buttons with links directly to my other pages. Simple and very clean.
